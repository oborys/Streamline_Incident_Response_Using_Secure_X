# Streamline Incident Response Using SecureX

Simplify, automate, and streamline incident response by integrating Secure X, Service Now, WebEx, with Umbrella & Cloud Security Analytics.

 
## Use Case Description

CloudAIR simplifies and automates incident response procedures for Amazon EC2 instances. Running the workflow on a schedule, it will query Cisco Umbrella, Cisco Secure Cloud Analytics (formerly known as Stealthwatch Cloud), and Amazon GuardDuty to detect indications of compromise. If a compromise is suspected, the workflow will create a ServiceNow ticket, generate a remediation request and push instance details and request WebEx room.

Incident response procedures are detailed in the published [Amazon AWS Incident Response Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/latest/aws-security-incident-response-guide/aws-security-incident-response-guide.pdf) and include:
  
  	• Enabling Termination Protection
	• Moving the compromised instance to an isolated security group.
	• Removing the instance from auto-scaling groups (ASGs).
	• Removing the instance from an elastic load balancer (ELB).
	• Creating forensic snapshots of elastic block devices.• • Adding tags to compromised hosts.
